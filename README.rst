About the docs
--------------
Docs are written as ``.rst`` files, rendered into HTML using `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ using some templates and CSS from the
official `Blender manual <https://www.blender.org/manual/>`_, and uploaded to
the ``gh-pages`` branch on github using the ``build-docs.sh`` script so they
can be viewed at https://daler.github.io/blender-for-3d-printing/contents.html.
