Introduction

This tutorial serves as a standalone introduction to using Blender for 3D printing. It intentionally skips over parts of
Blender to prioritize getting up to speed as quickly as possible. For further learning, there are many resources,
including:

    * `Blender Manual <https://www.blender.org/manual/>`_
    * `blender.stackexchange.com <http://blender.stackexchange.com/>`_
    * `blenderartists.org forum <http://blenderartists.org/forum/>`_
    * `List of support options at blender.org <http://www.blender.org/support/>`_

This tutorial is broken into three sections: Interface, Mesh Modeling, 3D Printing.

Starting Blender
================
After starting Blender and clicking to dismiss the splash screen, we see this default interface:

.. figure:: images/001.png
   :align: center

Here's an annotated version of the default layout:

.. figure:: images/002.png

   Blender's default layout

The interface is very customizable but we will be using this default layout. Most of our time will be spent in the 3D
View. The sections are:

1. Info
2. 3D View
3. Outliner *(used for complex scenes; we will be ignore this)*
4. Properties
5. Timeline *(used for animation; we will ignore this)*

.. seealso::


    The Blender manual on the `Interface
    <https://www.blender.org/manual/interface/index.html#interface>`_ has
    details about sections of the interface.
