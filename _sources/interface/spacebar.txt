Spacebar
========

There are many, many features in Blender but it's difficult to know where to
find them in the interface or to remember the hotkey. Luckily, the :kbd:`Space`
menu solves this with a search-as-you-type interface, so you just have to
remember the general idea of what you're trying to do.

    * Move the 3D Cursor somewhere away from the cube

    * Add a monkey (:kbd:`Space`, then start typing "monkey")

    * Align the monkey with the cube, using either :kbd:`Shift-S` or
      :kbd:`Space` to snap. Specifically:

        * snap 3D Cursor to cube
        * snap monkey to 3D Cursor

    * Delete the monkey
