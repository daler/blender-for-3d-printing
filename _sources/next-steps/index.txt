Next steps
==========
There's a lot we haven't covered here; here are some suggestions for what to
learn next.

* `Boolean modifier
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/booleans.html>`_,
  especially useful for "drilling" holes in meshes

* `Mirror modifier
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror.html>`_,
  useful for modeling symmetrical objects -- you only have to work on one side
  and the other side is updated automatically.

* `Solidify modifier
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/solidify.html>`_,
  useful for saving material (and money) by hollowing out large models

* `Advanced selection
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/meshes/selecting/advanced.html>`_,
  for all sorts of useful ways to select exactly the vertices you want.

* `Vertex painting
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/painting_sculpting/painting/vertex_paint/introduction.html>`_,
  for prints from services that support multiple colors.
