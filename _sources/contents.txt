 Blender for 3D Printing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This tutorial serves as a standalone introduction to using Blender for 3D
printing. It intentionally skips over parts of Blender to prioritize getting up
to speed as quickly as possible. For further learning, there are many
resources, including:

    * `Blender Manual <https://www.blender.org/manual/>`_
    * `blender.stackexchange.com <http://blender.stackexchange.com/>`_
    * `blenderartists.org forum <http://blenderartists.org/forum/>`_
    * `List of support options at blender.org <http://www.blender.org/support/>`_

This tutorial is broken into three sections: Interface, Mesh Modeling, 3D Printing.
