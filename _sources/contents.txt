 Blender for 3D Printing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This tutorial serves as a standalone introduction to using Blender for 3D
printing. It intentionally skips over parts of Blender to prioritize getting up
to speed as quickly as possible.

It is designed as the companion material for an in-person class, so many
details are intended to be filled out in lecture/demo format rather than in the
text here. The exercises along the way are designed to be performed
sequentially, and build upon one another.

The tutorial is divided into three sections:

:ref:`the_interface`
    Helps you get familiar with the interface; shows how to manipulate 3D
    objects in Blender

:ref:`mesh_modeling`
    Describes concepts and demonstrates tools for adding and changing mesh
    geometry

:ref:`printing`
    Practical guidelines and tips for a successful 3D print

What is Blender?
----------------

Blender is powerful free and open source 3D creation suite.  See the Blender
website for `features <https://www.blender.org/features/>`_, which include mesh
modeling, animation, a full video editor, game engine, camera and object
tracking, and more. People can (and do) make movies with it. We will just be
using its mesh modeling features.

Getting Blender
---------------
Available for Windows, Mac, Linux, FreeBSD from `blender.org
<https://www.blender.org/download/>`_. Download the zip file, uncompress it,
and run Blender right from it -- no installation necessary.
