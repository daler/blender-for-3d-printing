Next steps
==========
There's a lot we haven't covered here; here are some suggestions for what to
learn next.

* `Boolean modifier
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/booleans.html>`_,
  especially useful for "drilling" holes in meshes

* `Mirror modifier
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror.html>`_,
  useful for modeling symmetrical objects -- you only have to work on one side
  and the other side is updated automatically.

* `Solidify modifier
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/solidify.html>`_,
  useful for saving material (and money) by hollowing out large models

* `Advanced selection
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/meshes/selecting/advanced.html>`_,
  for all sorts of useful ways to select exactly the vertices you want.

* `Vertex painting
  <https://www.blender.org/manual/painting_sculpting/painting/vertex_paint/introduction.html>`_,
  for prints from services that support multiple colors.



Learning resources
------------------
If there's **a single resource** I could recommend specifically for 3D printing
it's the `tips for modeling in Blender for 3D printing
<http://www.sculpteo.com/en/tutorial/prepare-your-model-3d-printing-blender/>`_,
from `Sculpteo <http://www.sculpteo.com/>`_.

For further learning, there are many resources including:

    * `Blender Manual <https://www.blender.org/manual/>`_
    * `blender.stackexchange.com <http://blender.stackexchange.com/>`_
    * `blenderartists.org forum <http://blenderartists.org/forum/>`_
    * `List of support options at blender.org <http://www.blender.org/support/>`_
