Selecting
=========

We will be doing a *lot* of selection, so we'll get more practice as we go.

====================== ================================================
Action                  Description
====================== ================================================
:kbd:`RMB`              Select an object. This may be counterintuitive!
:kbd:`Shift-RMB`        Add another object to the selection
:kbd:`A`                Toggle the selection of all objects
:kbd:`Del` or :kbd:`X`  Delete an object from the scene
:kbd:`Ctrl-Z`           Undo last action
:kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-Z`     Redo last undo
====================== ================================================

.. figure:: /images/selected.png
    :width: 50%

    The cube on the right is selected

.. admonition:: Exercise: selecting and deleting
    :class: exercise

    * Deselect all (:kbd:`A`, may have to hit it a couple times)

    * Select the cube, then delete it (:kbd:`RMB`, :kbd:`X`)

    * Undo!  (:kbd:`Ctrl-Z`)

    * Deselect all (:kbd:`A`)

    * Select the camera (*the wireframe pyramid thing with an arrow sticking
      out of it*) and the lamp (*the dot surrounded by dotted lines*) and
      delete them.


    .. figure:: /images/camera.png
        :width: 150px

        Delete the camera

    .. figure:: /images/lamp.png
        :width: 150px

        Delete the lamp, too

    .. note::

         The camera and lamp are used for rendering images -- we don't need
         them for 3D printing work.

    The Blender documentation's `section on selecting
    <https://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/meshes/selecting/introduction.html>`_
    has lots more information and shows all sorts of ways to make a selection.
