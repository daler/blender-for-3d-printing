3D Print Toolbox
================

Blender has many available **Add-ons** or plugins. By default, not all are
pre-loaded. One of these is the 3D Print Toolbox, which we have to enable.

* :menuselection:`File --> User Preferences` (or :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-U`) to open the
  User Preferences menu.

* In the :menuselection:`Add-ons` tab, start typing `3d print` into the search
  bar. Once the "Mesh: 3D Print Toolbox" shows up, click the checkbox on the far
  right to enable this add-on.

    on the far right to enable

Understanding the options in the 3D Print Toolbox requires knowing about
problems that can occur in printing. Understanding those problems requires
knowing about the process of 3D printing.
