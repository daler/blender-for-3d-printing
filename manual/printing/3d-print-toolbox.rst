Blender's tools for checking models
===================================

Blender has many available **Add-ons** or plugins. By default, not all are
pre-loaded. One of these is the 3D Print Toolbox, which we have to enable.

We also have the `Mesh Analysis` panel, in the Properties Shelf, which has
a subset of the 3D Print Toolbox features:

      bar. Once the "Mesh: 3D Print Toolbox" shows up, click the checkbox on the far
      right to enable this add-on.
